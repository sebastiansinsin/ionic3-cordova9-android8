// YS:
client-pop-over.html buat apa?
environment.staging di services rawan problem
loadInvoices() di client service buat apa ya?
resize() kayanya ada better way to do. This one seems hacky
Create Client Error dari Server belum ada notification
Create Client Front end Validation belum ada sepertinya
Edit Client Error dari Server belum ada notifications
Validators Pattern on Name, Might need to allow number, so alphanumeric
Again resize needs to be reviewed, plus if later used needs to be put into service or helpers functions
Expense Server side validation not exist
Add client in Invoice / There are two button that call saveClient() with different argument structures padahal di TS only exist saveClient(client)
Add Client needs to be changed to Add Product in Invoices
Bad naming in add-from-product. saveClient(product)
// Rest of invoice parts pending after pull from Sebastian
Should be log out instead of log in in the menu
Belum ada validation whatsoever di payment
Popover Edit Payment, kalau go back masih ada popovernya
